### Hi there 👋

<!--
**ArkadiuszBOMA/ArkadiuszBOMA** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
💬 My name is Arek and I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer candidate.

🌱 I'm an IT enthusiast and English studies graduate which also happen to be my passion and hobby among many others which may include skiing and linguistics.

🤔 I consider myself meticulous and purposeful person on a self-development journey prepared to faced lots of challenges. On my journey I've already encountered many ups and downs but those downs motivate me the most. One of my personality traits is also curiosity and I like to do background research on many matters to get to the bottom of it so I can understand it fully.

⚡ In 2023 I've graduated from Codecool's Full Stack Developer course which has been a great foundation for both of my hard and soft skills. Regarding soft skills I've managed to gather experience in team work and self-presentation which may also involve communication, working under pressure, problem solving and many others. Considering hard skills I feel the most confident in back-end areas which may mostly include Java, Spring and Hibernate.

🔭 In my repository you can find some project that I've been working on.
